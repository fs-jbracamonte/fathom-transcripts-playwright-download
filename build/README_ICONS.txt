ICON FILES REQUIRED
==================

Please create or download the following icon files and place them in this build directory:

1. icon.ico - Windows icon (256x256 pixels recommended)
2. icon.icns - macOS icon (512x512 pixels recommended)
3. icon.png - Linux icon (512x512 pixels recommended)

You can use online tools to convert a single PNG image to these formats:
- https://convertio.co/png-ico/
- https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns
- Or use tools like IconWorkshop, GIMP, or Photoshop

For now, I've created placeholder files that need to be replaced with actual icon files.

Recommended icon design:
- Simple, clean design
- Include app name or recognizable logo
- Use transparent background
- High contrast for visibility
