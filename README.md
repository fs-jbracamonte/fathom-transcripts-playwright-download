# Fathom Meeting Transcript Extractor

A tool that automatically logs into Fathom.video and saves meeting transcripts as text files.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîê **Supports multiple authentication methods**: Google SSO, Microsoft SSO, and password login
- üìù **Extracts full meeting transcripts**: Not just summaries
- üîÑ **Smart retry logic**: Automatically retries failed extractions up to 5 times
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeout protection**: Won't hang indefinitely (2-minute limit per meeting)
- üéØ **Handles dynamic content**: Waits for loading overlays to disappear
- üìä **Detailed reporting**: Shows which transcripts succeeded or failed
- üíæ **Unique filenames**: Prevents overwrites with date + meeting name + ID format
- üîí **Secure mode**: Hide sensitive data during screen sharing
- üîç **Meeting filtering**: Filter by date range and/or meeting title

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Required Software

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Choose the "LTS" version
   - Run the installer with default settings

### Step 2: Set Up the Tool

1. **Open a terminal/command prompt** in the project folder

2. **Install the tool:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

### Step 3: Run Playwright from the CLI (Headless or Headed)

- Headless login without transcript extraction:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:HEADLESS="true"; $env:MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT="0"; npm run test:setup

# Mac/Linux
HEADLESS=true MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=0 npm run test:setup
```

- Headed login + optional transcript extraction:
```bash
# Shows the browser window
npm run test:setup:headed
```

- Extract N transcripts after login (works in both modes):
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT="5"; npm run test:setup      # headless if HEADLESS=true
$env:MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT="5"; npm run test:setup:headed

# Mac/Linux
MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=5 npm run test:setup
MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=5 npm run test:setup:headed
```

- Debug/Inspector (headed):
```bash
# Windows
$env:PWDEBUG="1"; npm run test:setup:headed

# Mac/Linux
PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:setup:headed
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Login

1. **Copy the configuration template:**
   - Find the file named `env.example`
   - Make a copy and rename it to `.env`

2. **Edit the `.env` file** with your information:
   ```env
   # Required: Your Fathom login credentials
   AUTH_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
   AUTH_PASSWORD=your-password
   
   # Optional: How many meeting transcripts to extract (0 = none, 5 = last 5 meetings)
   MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=5
   
   # Optional: Authentication provider (auto|google|microsoft|password)
   AUTH_PROVIDER=auto
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Tool

**Basic usage - Just login test:**
```bash
npx playwright test auth.setup --project=setup
```

**Extract transcripts from meetings:**
```bash
# Windows PowerShell:
$env:MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT="5"; npx playwright test auth.setup --project=setup

# Mac/Linux:
MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=5 npx playwright test auth.setup --project=setup
```

### Step 5: Run From the Electron App (UI)

1. Start the app UI:
```bash
npm run electron
```
2. Fill in Auth Provider, Username, Password.
3. Optional: Set date range filters, title filter, or choose a custom Transcript folder.
4. Click "Start Extraction". The browser runs minimized and logs stream into the app.
5. Use "Transcripts" and "Report" to open output locations.

## üìÅ Where to Find Your Transcripts

After running the tool, your transcripts will be saved in:
- **Folder:** `transcripts/`
- **Filename format:** `transcript_[date]_[meeting_name]_[meeting_id].txt`
- Each file contains the full meeting transcript with metadata
  
You can override the location by setting `TRANSCRIPT_PATH` in the environment or using the Electron app's "Browse" button.

## üîç Filtering Meetings

You can filter which meetings to extract by date range and/or title. Make sure to set `MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT` to a value greater than 0 to enable transcript extraction:

### Filter by Date Range
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:MEETING_DATE_START="2024-01-01"; $env:MEETING_DATE_END="2024-12-31"; npm run test:setup

# Mac/Linux  
MEETING_DATE_START=2024-01-01 MEETING_DATE_END=2024-12-31 npm run test:setup
```

### Filter by Meeting Title
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:MEETING_TITLE_FILTER="standup"; npm run test:setup

# Mac/Linux
MEETING_TITLE_FILTER=standup npm run test:setup
```

### Combine Filters
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:MEETING_DATE_START="2024-09-01"; $env:MEETING_TITLE_FILTER="weekly"; $env:MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT="5"; npm run test:setup

# Mac/Linux
MEETING_DATE_START=2024-09-01 MEETING_TITLE_FILTER=weekly MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=5 npm run test:setup
```

**Note:** Filters are applied before limiting by `MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT`. For example, if you have 100 meetings but only 10 match your filters, and you set `MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=5`, only the first 5 matching meetings will be processed.

### Using Filters in the Electron App

The Electron app provides a user-friendly interface for filtering:
- **Date Range**: Use the date pickers to select start and end dates
- **Title Filter**: Enter keywords to match in meeting titles
- Leave all filters empty to extract all meetings

The app automatically extracts all meetings that match your filter criteria.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Browser may not be secure" Error
**Solution:** Add these settings to your `.env` file:
```
SECURE_MODE=true
HEADLESS=true
```

### 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- The tool will wait up to 3 minutes for you to complete 2FA on your phone
- Have your phone ready when running the script

### Script Times Out or Hangs
**Solution 1:** Increase the wait time in your `.env` file:
```
WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
NAV_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
```

**Solution 2:** The script has built-in protections:
- Automatically handles loading overlays
- Has a 2-minute timeout per meeting transcript
- Retries failed extractions up to 5 times

### Playwright browsers in Electron builds
Browsers are bundled with the installer build. For local development, you can install Chromium via:
```bash
npm run install:browsers
```

### Simulate packaged mode in development
```bash
npm run prepare-build      # downloads Chromium and portable Node into build/
npm run electron:test-packaged
```
This makes Electron use the pre-bundled browsers and Node similarly to the installer.

### Can't See What's Happening
**Run in debug mode to watch the browser:**
```bash
# Windows:
$env:PWDEBUG="1"; npx playwright test auth.setup --project=setup

# Mac/Linux:
PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test auth.setup --project=setup
```

## üîê Security Notes

- Your password is stored locally in the `.env` file (never shared)
- The `.env` file is automatically excluded from version control
- Use `SECURE_MODE=true` to hide passwords during screen sharing

## üí° Tips

1. **First Time Setup:**
   - Test with `MAX_MEETINGS_TO_VISIT=1` first
   - Once working, increase the number

2. **Regular Use:**
   - The tool saves your login session
   - Delete `storage/auth.json` to force a fresh login

3. **Multiple Meetings:**
   - Each meeting gets its own transcript file
   - Files are named with date, meeting name, and unique ID to prevent overwrites

## üñ•Ô∏è Running From Electron vs CLI

- CLI is ideal for automation and CI. Use `HEADLESS=true` for silent runs.
- Electron UI is ideal for interactive SSO flows (Google/Microsoft) and easy filtering. Use the UI to enter credentials, set date/title filters, and monitor logs.

## üì¶ Build the Installer (Electron Builder)

1. Prepare the build (downloads Playwright Chromium and portable Node to bundle):
```bash
npm run prepare-build
```
2. Build for your OS:
```bash
# Windows
npm run dist-win

# macOS
npm run dist-mac

# Linux
npm run dist-linux
```
The output appears in the `dist/` folder. On Windows you‚Äôll get an installer `.exe` and a `win-unpacked/` folder.

Notes:
- The `dist*` scripts already run `prepare-build`; you can call them directly.
- Browsers and Node are pre-bundled so first run works offline.
- Code signing is disabled by default (`forceCodeSigning: false`).

## ‚ùì Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your login credentials in `.env`
3. Try running in debug mode to see what's happening
4. Make sure Fathom.video is accessible in your browser
